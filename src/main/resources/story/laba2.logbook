LOG ENTRY 541: Dr. Ingemar Jakobsson

The beasts respond negatively when fed. They are far too intelligent to be coaxed into cooperation.
Though regrettable, it appears that necessary force must be employed. We must set aside this ethical
concern, as the potential results of examining these anomalies could greatly improve the quality of life
for millions of people. When they first arrived, we observed their incredible resistance to psychological tampering,
as well as their minds' incredible regenerative abilities. We hope to find the source of these strange abilities, and
use them to find solutions for various neurological symptoms in humans. While they do not lack in physical fitness,
they seem to have been weakened as a result of the arrival incident. Therefore, it will not be difficult to restrain
them for further testing.
