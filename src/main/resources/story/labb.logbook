LOG ENTRY 684: Dr. Harry Wright
----------------
Today was a very successful day for the teams in the A wing... so much so that they required
a great deal of extra time before sending the results over. Unfortunately this means that this
entry must be rushed so we can all get out of here on time.

It would seem that we've finally made a breakthrough. We've not been given a thorough explanation
as of right now, but we've been presented with an extraordinary specimen that has finally allowed
us to complete our solution! Due to the lateness of this news, the specimen is being moved into
the vault for safekeeping until tomorrow morning. I'm sure everybody here is glad to have finally
reached the conclusion of our long endeavour.
